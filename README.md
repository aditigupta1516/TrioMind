🏥 Touchless Patient Data Navigator

Enable doctors to access and navigate patient data using voice and gesture controls — hands-free, sterile, and fast.

🚀 Purpose

Traditional patient data systems rely on touch input, which can be inconvenient or unsafe in sterile or emergency medical environments.
This project enables touchless interaction with patient records using voice commands and camera-based gesture recognition.

✨ Core Features
🎙️ Voice Commands

"Enable voice" → Activates mic + camera for touchless mode

"Disable voice" → Deactivates mic + camera

🖐️ Gesture Controls

👋 Swipe Left/Right → Navigate between sections

✋ Palm Gesture → Trigger emergency shortcut

📂 Patient Data Sections

Vitals

Medications

Medical History

Appointments

Lab Results

🖥️ UI/UX

Minimalist interface

Audio + haptic feedback for confirmation

Fallback to touch input when required

✅ Use Cases

Voice Command Activation: Say "Enable voice" to enter hands-free mode

Gesture Navigation: Swipe to move across patient sections, palm for emergency

Patient Data Access: Review vitals, history, medications, appointments, lab results

Error Recovery:

Falls back to touch if sensors fail

Handles unrecognized commands gracefully

Auto-reset after inactivity

⚙️ Technical Setup

Voice Recognition: Speech-to-Text API (e.g., Web Speech API)

Gesture Tracking: OpenCV camera-based hand tracking

Frontend/UI: Minimalist design with feedback mechanisms

Fallback: Default touch-based navigation for safety

🌟 Advantages

🧼 Reduces surface contact (improves hygiene in sterile zones)

⚡ Faster response than manual input during emergencies

♿ Accessible for doctors/nurses with mobility limitations

⚠️ Dependencies / Showstoppers
Voice Command

Microphone permissions required

Accent/dialect recognition accuracy

Noise interference in busy environments

Gesture Navigation

Lighting & camera resolution impact accuracy

Requires clear visibility of hand

Gesture calibration for diverse hand sizes

Error Recovery & Performance

Battery drain from always-on sensors

Multi-user voice overlap in shared spaces

Real-time processing latency for noise cancellation

🏥 Ideal For

Hospitals & ICUs
